# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Pedro
**Date:** 2025-12-06

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Creating reusable BMAD agent rules and context documents specialized for Zonesoft integrations

**Goals:** Identify what rules, context, and knowledge artifacts need to be created in this sandbox project to enable efficient Zonesoft integrations in future client projects

### Context Guidance

**Project Type:** Meta-project / Knowledge Base
- This is NOT a library for developers to use
- This IS a sandbox/training ground for developing BMAD agent rules and context
- Deliverable: Reusable BMAD rules and context documents that can be copied to new client projects
- Use case: When a new client needs a restaurant website with ordering, copy the rules/context from this project

**Key Exploration Areas:**
- What BMAD agent rules need to be created?
- What context documents are needed for Zonesoft integrations?
- How should these artifacts be structured for easy reuse?
- What Zonesoft-specific knowledge needs to be captured?
- How to organize and package these for easy copying to new projects?

### Session Setup

**Clarification Received:**
Pedro clarified that this project is about creating reusable BMAD agent knowledge rather than a developer library. The workflow is:
1. Develop and refine BMAD rules/context in this sandbox project
2. Copy those rules/context to new client projects
3. Use them to accelerate Zonesoft integrations in those projects

**Key Context:**
- Pedro has 4 years of Zonesoft software experience (valuable domain knowledge!)
- Limited API knowledge - needs API research/discovery first
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server creation is a possibility for Zonesoft API
- Research-first approach: Understand API capabilities before deciding knowledge base structure
